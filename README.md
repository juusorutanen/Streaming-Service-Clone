# Streaming-Service-Clone

A fun little project of trying to clone a streaming services' landing page. I used some parts from Netlix and some parts from Disney+'s landing page. 

I also wanted to use an API to add something extra, so I used TMDB Movie Api to display movie covers, which can be seen on the second section of the page. 

The website is mostly just CSS and HTML, but some JavaScript was also used for the API and accordions on the FAQ section.
