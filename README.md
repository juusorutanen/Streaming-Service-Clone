# Streaming-Service-Clone

A fun little project of trying to clone a streaming services' landing page. I used some parts from Netlix and some parts from Disney+'s landing page. 

I also wanted to use an API, so I used TMDB Movie Api to display movie covers, which can be seen on the second section of the page. 

In this project I improved my skills in making responsive layouts, CSS Grid, and how to use an API to display information.
